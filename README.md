# Invoice-System

I have made an Invoice System for a grocery shop. In it I used JAVA swings as a front end,
oracle database as backend and the connection was by JDBC. I learnt about
practical implementation of java. Like standard invoice I made fields for including a
product by both combo box and QR code scanning, for cashier and counter. Thus,
the operator has to select the product and its quantity and that product will be
inserted in editable table.
I used threading for dynamically changing the swings table, also for dynamically
updating time in seconds (I used Java calendar class for that). Also, for adding
products I used a separate application with administrative rights, thus all that
information is stored in DB, used normalization and primary keys to make it
efficient.
